The program can be compiled by opening the project file on qtCreator and building it.
The code is in c++.

The program uses a light source on the point vLightPosition (0.0, 4, 5.0). To change this point,
just change the variable inside the method initializeGL().

We were unable to allign the snake rings with the spline tangent, so we translated them to the
correct points, but alling with the xy plane.
